My major is architecture, but I strongly believe that the modern world can benefit from increased automation, enhancing both quality of life and product development. That's why I am diving into programming, hoping to discover an intersection between these fields where I can contribute to propelling the industry forward.

I personally believe SvelteKit should be used for the web, Rust for systems, Flutter for apps, and Python for everyday tasks. When working with a team or a company, we'll have to follow the rules though.
